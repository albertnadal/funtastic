# Funtastic!

This is a small project I’ve been working on during the Christmas holidays. **Funtastic** is a simple and fun game to enjoy with the family.
Inspired by old Nintendo Wii games, this game uses Javascript and the p5.js library, with body position detection powered by ml5.js and TensorFlow.js. Additionally, the game uses the Speech Recognition API from modern web browsers to enhance user interaction. After several hours of work, it’s time to test it with some good company.

## Play the game online!

Remember, to interact with the game, you only need to use your voice and move your body. Therefore, make sure to enable browser permissions for accessing the microphone and webcam.
